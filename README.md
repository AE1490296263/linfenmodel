# Colorectal Diagnosis Model Deployment

This project is a web application for predicting colorectal cancer and polyps using a machine learning model. The application is built with Flask and uses SHAP for model interpretability.

## Features

- Predicts the probability of colorectal cancer and polyps based on input features.
- Generates SHAP plots to explain model predictions.
- User-friendly web interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Joblib
- Pandas
- SHAP
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place the trained model file (`结直肠模型.joblib`) in the project root directory.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.
